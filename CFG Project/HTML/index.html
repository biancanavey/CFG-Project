                <h2>Harriet Tubman</h2>
                <p>Harriet Tubman was an American abolitionist and political activist. 
                Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made  
                13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people,
                including family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and 
                safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.</p>

                <p>
                    Anne Frank was a teenage Jewish girl who kept a diary while her family was in hiding
                     from the Nazis during World War II. For two years, she and seven others lived in a 
                     "Secret Annex" in Amsterdam before being discovered and sent to concentration camps.
                      Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945.Frank's father was the family's sole survivor. 
                      He decided to publish the diary, which gives a detailed account of Anne's thoughts, feelings 
                      and experiences while she was in hiding. It has been an international bestseller for decades 
                      and a key part of Holocaust education programs. Several humanitarian organizations are devoted 
                      to her legacy."Anne was a lively and talented girl, expressing her observations, feelings,
                       self-reflections, fears, hopes and dreams in her diary," said Annemarie Bekker of the Anne 
                       Frank House in Amsterdam. "Her words resonate with people all around the world."

                     <h2>Rosa Parks</h2>
                     <p>Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist.</p>
                     <p>Parks was active in the fight for racial justice and became the secretary for the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP in 1943. However, Parks is more widely known for her bus journey home from work in 1955.</p>
                     <p>Parks took a seat at the front of the bus, which was deemed the white section under segregation laws. The driver asked Parks to stand up and give her seat to a white man. Three Black individuals obeyed the driver’s order and moved to the back of the bus, but Parks refused. It was this journey home that jumpstarted the civil rights movement.</p>

                <h2>Maya Angelou</h2>
                <p>Maya Angelou was a poet, singer, memoirist, and civil rights activist.
                    Angelou had a difficult childhood growing up in Arkansas. Not only did she experience racial prejudices and discrimination she was also traumatised as she faced abuse from her mother’s boyfriend. This led to Angelou becoming mute for years.</p>
                </p>Despite these early challenges, Angelou broke literacy history, as her award-winning memoir ‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings’ became the first non-fiction best-seller by an African-American woman. Angelou went on to become one of the greatest voices in the civil rights movement.</p>
                <p>Angelou shared her passion for literature with the world and how it can help those who were silenced find their voices once again.</p>
