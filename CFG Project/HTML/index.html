                <h2>Harriet Tubman</h2>
                <p>Harriet Tubman was an American abolitionist and political activist. 
                Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made  
                13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people,
                including family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and 
                safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.</p>

                <h2>Anne Frank</h2>
                <p>
                    Anne Frank was a teenage Jewish girl who kept a diary while her family was in hiding
                     from the Nazis during World War II. For two years, she and seven others lived in a 
                     "Secret Annex" in Amsterdam before being discovered and sent to concentration camps.
                      Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945.Frank's father was the family's sole survivor. 
                      He decided to publish the diary, which gives a detailed account of Anne's thoughts, feelings 
                      and experiences while she was in hiding. It has been an international bestseller for decades 
                      and a key part of Holocaust education programs. Several humanitarian organizations are devoted 
                      to her legacy."Anne was a lively and talented girl, expressing her observations, feelings,
                       self-reflections, fears, hopes and dreams in her diary," said Annemarie Bekker of the Anne 
                       Frank House in Amsterdam. "Her words resonate with people all around the world."
